# TODOs

## Chart editor

Make the none option only visible if something is selected (eg not placeholder)

Get working on large dataset using SQL/DuckDB, integrate into Workspace

Integrate into existing visualize page

Better visualize page with new fields.

## Recommendations

Move data into regular Redux so Vega/CompassQL can mutate - add Symbols to it, get CSQL working

# TODOs

## Meta

- [ ] better habit of writing conventional commits
- [ ] generate a changelog
- [ ] deploy more frequently, eg after 3 good changes (eg looking at prod loqu for example datasets shows extra vertical spacing for `Field`s and no tooltip on `Plot` hover)

## Chart editor

Make the none option only visible if something is selected (eg not placeholder)

Get working on large dataset using SQL/DuckDB, integrate into Workspace

Integrate into existing visualize page

Better visualize page with new fields.

## Recommendations

- [x] Move data into regular Redux so Vega/CompassQL can mutate - add Symbols to it, get CSQL working

## Field View

Add little pill buttons to sort by type: nominal, quantitative, temporal, etc.

- [x] Implement the Show in/Add to Chart Editor
- [ ]
